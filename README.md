# DL_AgeDetection
Age detection using RNN on CACD dataset

Raw image without processing is available at the below website:

I have processed the images and saved the code for preprocessing in the preprocess section along with an example.

After preprocessing, I used Resnet50 to train the model using transfer learning, the code is in the Model_training section
